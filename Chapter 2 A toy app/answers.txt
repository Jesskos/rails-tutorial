Section 2.2.1
1. (For readers who know CSS) Create a new user, then use your browser’s HTML inspector to determine the CSS id for the text “User was successfully created.” What happens when you refresh your browser?

- it has the id "notice"
- although notice still exists in the html, it is no longer on the page

2. What happens if you try to create a user with a name but no email address?
It still creates a user, but email is left blank

3. What happens if you try create a user with an invalid email address, like “@example.com”?
- email still creates 

4. Destroy each of the users created in the previous exercises. Does Rails display a message by default when a user is destroyed?
yes

Section 2.2.2
1. By referring to Figure 2.11, write out the analogous steps for visiting the URL /users/1/edit.

1. Browser issues a request for the users/1/edit URL (same)
2. Rails routes /users/1/edit in the edit action in Users Controller (same)
3. The edit action asks the User model to retrieve user 1's information
4. The User model pulls user 1's information from the database
5. The User model returns user 1 to the controller
6. The controller captures the users information, which is passed back to edit
7. view sends its HTML to controller
8. Controller then sends HTML info from view to browser

2. Find the line in the scaffolding code that retrieves the user from the database in the previous exercise.

~controller.users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  # GET /users/1/edit
  def edit
  end

3. What is the name of the view file for the user edit page?
edit.html.erb
